                 "As I relax on the sofa and gaze around a room a thought hits me:
                 this is exactly the place I've been looking for all my life.
                 A little hideaway in some sinkhole somewhere.
                I'd always thought of it as a secret, imaginary place, and can barely believe that it actually exists.
                I close my eyes and take a breath, and wonder of it all settles over me like a gentle cloud."
